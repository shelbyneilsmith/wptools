6.0.0.0 - 2015-05-04 - Dustin Bolton
	Deployment
		New "BackupBuddy Deployment" remote destination allowing pushing or pulling your entire site to or from another existing site, in as few as two clicks.
		See differences in site server settings, active plugins, theme, versions, and media prior to deploying.
		Options to transfer the database (all tables, some, or none), plugins, theme, and/or media.
		Automatic migration of URLs, paths, and other settings just like manual migrations.
		Watch the deployment progress just like a normal backup, displaying a continuous status including a detailed advanced status log of the entire process, all in one place.
		Ability to undo the database changes with one click if something goes wrong prior to confirming the deployment once you're satisfied.
		Automatic chunking of data transferred between servers to support large files or slow servers.
		Swaps databases only after the entire database and all files have been transferred to attempt to minimize site downtime to mere seconds (or less!).
		Perfect for developing your site in a different location from the live site.  Use staging best practices.
	Google Drive Destination
		Intelligent hybrid of chunking & bursting for better handling large files & server performance fluctuations by automatically scaling as needed. Automatic "smart" adjustment during transfers to handle your specific server's speeds and abilities.
		Directory selector for easily finding where to store files or creating new folders.
		Per-backup archive limits based on the backup type.
		List, delete, and download remote backups (remote management may be disabled when creating new destination).

		limit by age
		Improved limit controls for most destinations
	Performance & Reliability

		State data is now only output to browser javascript console when full logging mode is enabled.
		Debugging backup process data only sent to browser javascript console when in development mode.
		Fileoptions storage of the backup state now clears step arguments for finished functions to prevent buildup of state data once a function has passed (eg for deployment state or new alternate zip method state) to prevent rapid uncontrolled fileoptions file growth.

		Each time a remote send status is updated now updates "time_updated" entry with current timestamp.
		Remote destination sends that have not been updated after a period of time are now marked as timed out and send notification email.
		Old status logs will now be removed after 10 days rather than 2 days.
		Fixed "File destination send finished email recipient(s)" feature not sending notification emails.
		Fixed issue 'Manual Backup With Send and Delete After Reports ZIP File Not Found at End' by no longer wiping send_remote_destination step information from fileoptions after function finish.
		Fixed timing issue / race condition where _getBackupStatus.php retrieving fileoptions could possibly retrieve the file mid-write, resulting in an incomplete serialized array being returned and a fatal error #9031b.  If this happens then it will sleep for 1 second, up to 10 times, re-checking the fileoptions file for valid contents prior to proceeding.
		Classic mode: Fixed possible javascript error when running under Classic Mode due to retrieving scrollHeight of non-existant status box.
