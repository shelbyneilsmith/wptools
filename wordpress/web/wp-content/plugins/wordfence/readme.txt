Wordfence Security is a free enterprise class security plugin that includes a firewall, virus scanning, real-time traffic with geolocation and more. 

== Description ==

Wordfence Security is a free enterprise class security plugin that includes a firewall, anti-virus scanning, malicious URL scanning and live traffic including crawlers. Wordfence is the only WordPress security plugin that can verify and repair your core, theme and plugin files, even if you don't have backups.

Wordfence is now Multi-Site compatible. 

[Remember to visit our support forums if you have questions or comments.](http://wordfence.com/forums/)

Wordfence is 100% free. We also offer a Premium API key that lets you block countries and schedule scans for specific times.

Wordfence:

* Scans core files, themes and plugins against WordPress.org repository versions to check their integrity.
* WordPress Multi-Site (or WordPress MU in the older parlance) compatible.
* Wordfence Security for multi-site also scans all posts and comments across all blogs from one admin panel.
* Premium users can also block countries and schedule scans for specific times and a higher frequency.
* See how files have changed. Optionally repair changed files that are security threats.
* Scans for signatures of over 44,000 known malware variants that are known security threats.
* Scans for many known backdoors including C99, R57, RootShell, Crystal Shell, Matamu, Cybershell, W4cking, Sniper, Predator, Jackal, Phantasma, GFS, Dive, Dx and many many more.
* Continuously scans for malware and phishing URL's including all URL's on the Google Safe Browsing List in all your comments, posts and files that are security threats.
* Scans for heuristics of backdoors, trojans,  suspicious code and other security issues.
* Checks the strength of all user and admin passwords to enhance login security.
* Monitor your DNS security for unauthorized DNS changes.
* Includes a firewall to block common security threats like fake Googlebots, malicious scans from hackers and botnets.
* Rate limit or block security threats like aggressive crawlers, scrapers and bots doing security scans for vulnerabilities in your site.
* Choose whether you want to block or throttle users and robots who break your security rules.
* Includes login security to lock out brute force hacks and to stop WordPress from revealing info that will compromise security.
* See all your traffic in real-time, including robots, humans, 404 errors, logins and logouts and who is consuming most of your content. Enhances your situational awareness of which security threats your site is facing.
* A real-time view of all traffic including automated bots that often constitute security threats that Javascript analytics packages never show you.
* Real-time traffic includes reverse DNS and city-level geolocation. Know which geographic area security threats originate from.
* Monitors disk space which is related to security because many DDoS attacks attempt to consume all disk space to create denial of service.
* Our online forums are available 24/7 to answer your WordPress security questions. 

Wordfence Security is full-featured and constantly updated by our team to incorporate the latest security features and to hunt for the 
newest security threats to your WordPress website.

== Installation ==

To install Wordfence Security and start protecting your WordPress website:

[Remember to visit our support forums if you have questions or comments.](http://wordfence.com/forums/)

1. Install Wordfence Security automatically or by uploading the ZIP file. 
1. Activate the security plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Wordfence is now activated. Go to the scan menu and start your first security scan. Scheduled security scanning will also be enabled.
1. Once your first scan has completed a list of security threats will appear. Go through them one by one to secure your site.
1. Visit the Wordfence options page to enter your email address so that you can receive email security alerts.
1. Optionally change your security level or adjust the advanced options to set individual security scanning and protection options for your site.
1. Click the "Live Traffic" menu option to watch your site activity in real-time. Situational awareness is an important part of website security.

To install Wordfence on WordPress Multi-Site installations (support is currently in Beta):

1. Install Wordfence Security via the plugin directory or by uploading the ZIP file.
1. Network Activate Wordfence Security. This step is important because until you network activate it, your sites will see the plugin option on their plugins menu. Once activated that option dissapears. 
1. Now that Wordfence is network activated it will appear on your Network Admin menu. Wordfence will not appear on any individual site's menu. 
1. Go to the "Scan" menu and start your first security scan. 
1. Wordfence will do a security scan all files in your WordPress installation including those in the blogs.dir directory of your individual sites. 
1. Live Traffic will appear for ALL sites in your network. If you have a heavily trafficked system you may want to disable live traffic which will stop logging to the DB. 
1. Firewall rules and login rules apply to the WHOLE system. So if you fail a login on site1.example.com and site2.example.com it counts as 2 failures. Crawler traffic is counted between blogs, so if you hit three sites in the network, all the hits are totalled and that counts as the rate you're accessing the system.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

[Remember to visit our support forums if you have questions or comments.](http://wordfence.com/forums/)

= What does Wordfence Security do that other WordPress security plugins don't do? =

* Wordfence security scans check all your files, comments and posts for URL's in Google's Safe Browsing list.
* All Wordfence security scans happen hourly instead of daily or even less frequently.
* Wordfence scans do not consume large amounts of your precious bandwidth because all scans happen on your web server which makes them very fast.
* Wordfence fully supports WordPress Multi-Site which means you can security scan every blog in your Multi-Site installation with one click.
* Wordfence checks the integrity of your WordPress core files, plugins and themes against the original files in the WordPress repository. We alert you to any changes which may be a security threat, let you see what has changed and you can even repair changed files.

= Does Wordfence support Multi-Site installations? =

Yes. WordPress MU or Multi-Site as it's called now is fully supported. Using Wordfence you can security scan every blog in your network with one click. If one of your customers posts a page or post with a known malware URL that threatens your whole domain with being blacklisted by Google, we will tell you within a maximum of one hour which is how often scans occur. 

= Will Wordfence slow my site down? =

We have spent a lot of time making sure Wordfence runs very quickly and securely. Wordfence uses its own database
tables and advanced mysql features to ensure it runs as fast as possible. The creators of Wordfence
also run Feedjit, a large scale real-time analytics product and ad network and much of the technology and knowledge from
our real-time analytics products is built into Wordfence.

= How often is Wordfence updated? =

The Wordfence security plugin is frequently updated and we update the code on our security scanning servers
more frequently. Our cloud servers are continually updated with the latest known security threats and vulnerabilities so
that we can blog any security threat as soon as it emerges in the wild.

= What if I need support? =

All our paid customers receive priority support. Excellent customer service is a key part
of being a Wordfence member. You can also [visit our support forums where we provide free support for all Wordfence users](http://wordfence.com/forums/) and answer any security releated questions you may have.

= Can I disable certain security features of Wordfence? =

Yes! Simply visit the Options page, click on advanced options and enable or disable the security features you want.

= What if my site security has already been compromised by a hacker? =

Wordfence is the only security plugin that is able to repair core files, themes and plugins on sites where security is already compromised.
However, please note that site security can not be assured unless you do a full reinstall if your site has been hacked. We recommend you only
use Wordfence to get your site into a running state in order to recover the data you need to do a full reinstall. A full reinstall is the only
way to ensure site security once you have been hacked. 

= How will I be alerted that my site has a security problem? =

Wordfence sends security alerts via email. Once you install Wordfence, you will configure a list of email addresses where security alerts will be sent.
When you receive a security alert, make sure you deal with it promptly to ensure your site stays secure.

= My WordPress site is behind a firewall. Doesn't that make it secure? =

If your site is accessible from the web, it means that people you don't know can execute PHP code on your site.
They have to be able to execute PHP code, like the core WordPress code, in order for your site to work. 
Most WordPress security threats allow a hacker to execute PHP code on your website. The challenge hackers
face is how to get their malicious PHP code onto your site to compromise your security. There
are many upload mechanisms that WordPress itself, themes and plugins offer and the vast majority of these
are secure. However, every now and then a hacker discovers an upload mechanism that is not secure or 
a way of fooling your site into allowing an upload. That is usually when security is compromised. Even
though your site is behind a commercial firewall, it still accepts web requests that include uploads and executes PHP code
and as long as it does that, it may become face a security vulnerability at some point.

= Will Wordfence protect me against the Timthumb security problem? =

The timthumb security exploit occurred in 2011 and all good plugins and themes now use an updated 
version of timthumb (which the creator of Wordfence wrote and donated to the timthumb author) which closes the security hole that
caused the problem. However we do scan for old version of timthumb for good measure to make sure they don't 
cause a security hole on your site. 

= People keep telling me that WordPress itself has security problems. Is that true? =

In general, no it's not. The WordPress team work very hard to keep the awesome software they have produced secure and in the
rare cases when a security hole is found, they fix it very quickly. Most responsible plugin authors also fix security holes
as soon as they are told about them. That's why Wordfence will warn you if you're running an old version of WordPress, a plugin
or a theme, because often these have been updated to fix a security hole.


== Screenshots ==

1. The home screen of Wordfence where you can see a summary, manage security issues and do a manual security scan. 
2. The Live Traffic view of Wordfence where you can see real-time activity on your site.
3. The "Blocked IPs" page where you can manage blocked IP's, locked out IP's and see recently throttled IPs that violated security rules.
4. The basic view of Wordfence options. There is very little to configure other than your alert email address and security level.
5. If you're technically minded, this is the under-the-hood view of Wordfence options where you can fine-tune your security settings.

* Admins can now also disable firewall and login security from the unlock-me email, just in case of emergency.
* Made advanced options visible so you know they exist.
* Fixed dns_get_record() function not existing bug on Windows sytems pre PHP 5.3.0. Was causing scans to hang.

* Max memory size for scans is now configurable for larger installations. 256M is the default.
* Changed maximum scan time to 10 minutes. 

= 1.5.3 =
* A harmless cosmetic error was being thrown up when some security scans started. Fixed that.

= 1.5.2 =
* Changed max scan time to 30 mins.

= 1.5.1 =
* Fixed a bug that caused scans to crash when permissions don't allow a directory to be read.

= 1.4.8 =

= 1.4.5 =
* Bugfix - fixed bug that caused Wordfence menu to dissapear.

= 1.4.4 =
* WordPress Multi-site support added. Currently in Beta. Tested with subdomains, not subdirectories, but it should work great on both.
* Main changes are moving menus to the Network Admin area, preventing individual blogs from enabling the plugin and dealing with database prefix issues.

= 1.4.3 =
* Improved diagnistic information on binary and regular API calls for better debugging.
* Changed ticker to only show activity with level < 3

= 1.4.2 =
* Email to send security alerts to is now configured at the same time an API key is entered.

= 1.4.1 =
* This is a major release, please upgrade immediately.
* Only scan files in the WordPress ABSPATH root directory and known WordPress subdirectories. Prevents potentially massive scans on hosts that have large dirs off their wordpress root.
* Don't generate plain SHA hashes anymore because we don't currently use them on the server side for scanning. (Still generates md5's and SHAC)
* No longer do change tracking on files before scans because the change tracking does almost the same amount of work when generating hashes as the actual scan. So just do the scan, which is now faster.
* Updated internal version to 1.2 to use new code on the server side which sends back a list of unknown files rather than known files, which is usually smaller and more network efficient.
* Improved logging in activity log.
* Removed SSL peer verification because some hosts have bad cert config. Connection to our servers is still via SSL. 
* Fixed a few minor issues. Overall you should notice that scans are much faster now.

= 1.3.3 =
* Made real-time server polling more efficient.
* Entering your API key now automatically starts your first scan. Was causing some confusion.
* Link to forums added for free customer support.

= 1.3.2 =
* Reduced the number of database connections that Wordfence makes to one.
* Modified the memory efficient unbuffered queries we use to only use a single DB connection.
* Removed status updates during post and comment scans which prevents interference with unbuffered queries and makes the scans even faster.

= 1.3.1 =
* Fixed a bug where if you have the plugin "secure-wordpress" installed, you can't do a Wordfence scan because it says you have the wrong version. This is because secure-wordpress trashes the $wp_version global variable to hide your version rather than using the filters provided by WordPress. So coded a workaround so that your Wordfence scans will work with that plugin installed.

= 1.3 =
* Minor fix to point to the correct binary API URL on the Wordfence cloud servers.

= 1.2 =
* It is now free to get a Wordfence API key.
* Premium keys include theme and plugin file verification which consumes resources on the Wordfence servers.
* Various bugfixes and performance enhancements.

= 1.1 =
* Initial public release of Wordfence.

== Upgrade Notice ==
= 3.1.1 =
Upgrade immediately. Fixes bug introduced in last release that broke permenent IP blocking.

= 3.0.9 =
Upgrade immediately. Fixes two critical bugs: Could not get admin ID bug and permanent IP blocks not staying permanent. 

= 3.0.6 =
Upgrade immediately. Improves malware URL detection by 20% or more.

= 3.0.3 =
Upgrade immediately. This release fixes an issue that caused Wordfence to show all your core files
missing under certain conditions. It was usually caused by high load on our scanning server and the
plugin not handling an error condition halfway through the scan correctly.

= 3.0.2 =
Upgrade immediately. This release drastically reduces memory, reduces new DB connections created by 
Wordfence to zero (we simply reuse the WordPress DB handle), reduces the number of DB queries to 
about 1% of the previous version by removing unneeded status messages and fixes a bug that 
could cause Wordfence to launch multiple concurrent scans that can put high load on your system.
This is a critical release. Upgrade immediately.
